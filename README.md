# Basic discord bot
This bot is written in C# and uses the [NuGet package Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)  So all kudos goes to that guy!

# Booting the bot
To prevent people from using my bot token, the token has to be places in a document (so the token is not hardcoded). This has to be located in: %userprofile%/documents/discord_bot/token.txt.
